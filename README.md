# MMDA-Project

This project is an MMDA (Multi-Media Database Aggregator).

The function of this project is storing meta data for user uploaded files. 
The user can either provide the path to a single file or to a directory.
If they choose the latter, all files contained within the directory
(and subsequent directories) will be be analyzed and added to the database.

This application uses mySql which should be running in order for this
application to work.

This project was created for CMSC424 at University of Maryland, College Park
with Professor Nick Roussopoulos.
